XXPalk is a IM of Linux with all google talk functions: chat, voip, file transfer...
It use the libjingle witch is a C++ lib developped by google. It contains google talk's API,
but that's juste a very small part of the lib. If you are interested in STUN, P2P, multimedia stream of network...
It's a very nice tool.

Google talk is a really good IM which is small, and with high quality voice chat. But It just exite in Windows, 
Wine doesn't work for it, and I did'nt find others IM like AMSN for msn in Windows. Yes, Tapioca is a such of thing, 
but it's toooooooooooo hard to install, too old, which depense on a lot of strange libs, and after 1 whole days of installation,
It's "nice" voice quality killed me... It use DBUS for the connexion, so once I quit the programme incorrectly, my gmail account
is still connecting with google server and that makes me impossible to connect the service again...My friends asked me why you
are always online and never talk with them which is really not...

From 2006 some google guys said that they will make the linux version, so does Pindgin's leader... but what's the date today? 2009!!!
I can't wait any more, My girlfriend can't wait any more. Is it so difficult? Or juste some other reason like the money? the lisence?
I maked it myself. Of cause with google's lib...anyway, i made it myself, just for google talk's good service and the need of my self.
I don't have a lot of time, 1 whole weeks work can't do so much. This first version is more or less a commande programme with no GUI, but really with all functions of google talk in Windows. The commande mode is easy to use if u don't need too much of the text chat function. But I really know that a such of the thing can kill a lot of people, I dont want to do that. I love libQt but this will kill even more people...So I chose Java, just for making a quite simple interface. U can say It's ugly, and I will never say that I made that interface :)

If u want get the whole functions, i suggest u to use the commande version as the GUI version can't access the file, I guess it's the problem of authority of the files of caused by java, I hav'nt fixed it yet, I dont know too much about java, maybe it will still existe in the next version... I don't quit care the file transfer fonction, I really mean that :) . If you find the solution, please
please please email me (xiongq@gmail.com), thank you very much of avance.

you can read readme in XXPalk/ to get more information about google's libjingle.

For compile and run my programme is very easy. just install the dependence libs and type "make" in your terminal, and u can find 
my programme in talk/example/call.  Just use the "./XXPalk_ui" to execute the java interface. One image on the interface and no sounds because i'm afraid of the lisence neither...

if you get problems, you should read FAQ first, at least you need to install all the libs dependence.

After the compilation of all the source, you can go to talk/example/xxpalk and execute "./XXPalk_ui" for GUI(This file will launch my programme of XXPalk with a JAVA interface) or"./xxpalk" with mode commande .  For this version I didnt take much care about the GUI, I'm not a expert of UI, i'll try my best maybe 
in the next version if needed...

enjoy it,

By the way, all my own programme is free for every one. So you can take it to make ur own google talk. U C, that's another advantage of my commande mode programme, you can add your own cool interface on it :)

Bonne continuation et bon courrage.

XXP
