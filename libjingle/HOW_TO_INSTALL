On Ubuntu for building you'll need (use sudo apt-get install):

build-essential
libogg-dev


these 4 lib is normally included, if not, please intall them
libortp7-dev
libspeex-dev
libmediastreamer0-dev
libexpat1-dev


suggested on Ubuntu:

libmediastreamer0-dev
libspeexdsp-dev

Then

    * Extract the tar.gz file into any folder you like (tar -xvf <version>.tar.gz)
    * Change into the created directory, add execute permissions to ./make (chmod +x ./make) and run ./make 
    * if everything goes alright, u can just go to the directory XXPalk/talk/examples/xxpalk, and execute "./XXPalk_ui" , 
      this commande will launch my programme with a simple Java GUI. 
      If you like commande line, you can run ./xxpalk, this will run XXPalk with a commande mode.

if you get any probleme, please check the erroe information and verify if you have installed all the libs dependence.

If always can't run it, contact me xiongq@gmail.commande

here is some more information to solve your problem

libs suggested: 

    libmediastreamer0-dev
    libspeexdsp-dev

for some distributions, ex: UBUNTU, u will nedd these libs to get a sound.
Maybe it's juste my problème, but these libs really solved it.

If you have installed these libs succesfully, normally you can compile libjingle and my programme with no difficult.

Attention!!!

there are bugs in libjingle, I have fixed some, but i belive there are more...cause I've just used less than 30% of them just for google talk kind fonctions. So dont so strust this lib, or it will really kill your programme. Otherwise, C'est un très bon outil!!!

Bon courage.
