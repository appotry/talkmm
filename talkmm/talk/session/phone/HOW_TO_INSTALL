On Ubuntu for building you'll need (use sudo apt-get install):

build-essential

libogg-dev

libmediastreamer0-dev
libspeexdsp-dev

Then

    * Extract the tar.gz file into any folder you like (tar -xvf <version>.tar.gz)
    * Change into the created directory, add execute permissions to ./make (chmod +x ./make) and run ./make 
    * if no error, change into XXPalk/talk/examples/xxpalk
    * if you want to run the program with GUI, then execute ./XXPalk_ui, else if you prefer commande line, the execute ./xxpalk
    * that's it, enjoy it!!!
